# Debunking_Computer_Vision_Taphonomic_Equifinality


### How to structure data:

For computer vision analysis data must simply be in a folder called DS1, DS2 or DS3. For deep learning applications, data must be in a folder called "Train" within either "DS1", "DS2", or "DS3". The code will then sort the data from the train folder into either the test or validation folder.
